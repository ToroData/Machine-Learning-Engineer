"""
This module is responsible for scoring a trained machine learning model.
It loads a trained model from disk, uses it to make predictions on test data,
calculates the F1 score, and saves the score to a file.

Modules:
    - pandas: Provides data manipulation capabilities.
    - pickle: Allows for serialization of Python objects.
    - os: Provides operating system-related functionalities.
    - sys: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.
    - json: Provides JSON file handling.
    - logging: Enables logging for debugging and monitoring.
    - sklearn.metrics: Scikit-learn library for machine learning metrics.
    - training: A custom module for splitting data.

Functions:
    - load_model(model_path: str): Loads a trained model from disk.
    - score_model(): Scores the loaded model on test data and saves the F1 score.
