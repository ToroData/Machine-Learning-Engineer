"""
Model Deployment Script

This script is responsible for deploying the trained model and related files to
the production deployment directory.
It copies the trained model (trainedmodel.pkl), model score (latestscore.txt),
and ingested data record (ingestedfiles.txt)
to the production deployment directory specified in the 'config.json' file.

Modules:
    - os: Provides operating system-related functionalities.
    - shutil: Provides file operations for copying files.
    - json: Provides JSON file handling.

Functions:
    - deploy_model(): Copies the necessary files to the production deployment directory.
